					characterBio: 'As a senior network technician for cyber security firm Allsafe, Elliot protects corporate clients including the ubiquitous Evil Corp from security breaches and data theft. As a vigilante hacker, he monitors the people in his daily life and protects those hes close to from their own flaws, sometimes with unpredictable results. Originally from Washington Township, New Jersey, Elliot now lives alone on the Lower East Side. He suffers from crippling anxiety, which stems from memories of his difficult childhood. His father died when Elliot was young, and his now-estranged mother was brutally cruel. Elliot has spent most of his adult life isolated from the world around him. After being arrested for financial hacking, he has been attending court-ordered therapy for almost a year. Elliot, however, prefers self-medication by morphine, an addiction he mediates with suboxone. He obtains both from his next door neighbor, Shayla. With the arrival of Mr. Robot, Elliots world changes entirely. Fsocietys members and mission offer him a renewed purpose -- though accompanied by a risk of heightened paranoia -- leaving him faced with the question of whether to numbly continue the life he knows or risk everything and participate in Mr. Robots revolution.',
