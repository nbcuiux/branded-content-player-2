A server hosts a "channel" where users can join to discuss various topics. However, "robots" are prevalent on servers. These allow users to communicate with the server itself, and request file transfers. There is a major presence of illegal file transfers facilitated by the use of these robots.'}

It\'s a tactic used to prevent a company\'s servers from functioning by using all their bandwidth. Real or virtual computers all send and receive data to all servers on a network, stopping legitimate users from exercising real transactions. This effectively stops business from taking place, causing a loss in revenue and consumer trust.'}
